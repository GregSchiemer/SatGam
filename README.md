# Satellite Gamelan

This project renders a synchronised multiplayer interface using ES6 canvas animation and gesture-triggered audio synthesised via Csound WebAssembly. It was designed principally as a concert app and written in javaScript as a replacement for an earlier version written in Objective-C. The UI is designed for a portrait-mode mobile screen (`390×844`).

## Features

- 🎨 Canvas-based layout and animation in pure ES6 modules
- 🎵 Csound audio synthesis via dynamic gesture-triggered loading
- ✅ Mobile-friendly, multi-player, autoplay-policy compliant
- 🔁 Collaborative GUI for a consort players synchronised by a lead player

The app can be launched using 1 of 2 html files depending on the role :

-=- **Lead player** (`leader.html`) — lead player taps the clock to start the animation sequence
- **Consort** (`consort.html`) — all players trigger sounds by tapping sprites enabled by the animation sequence
- Both versions display the same 25-key layout and interactive clock

The leader's role is: 
- to start the animation sequence in sync on all phones;
- to select 1 of 2 playing modes:

    1. **PREVIEW** : plays 'fast-forward' giving players an overview of the changing UI
    2. **CONCERT** : plays in real-time and lasts between 12:24 and 12:48 seconds

## Getting Started

### How to create and use SatGam HTTPS certificates on the MacBook server for the AX73 concert network

SatGam’s browser audio path uses secure-context web features associated with Csound Web Assembly, so for phone deployment it must be served over **HTTPS** with **WSS** for WebSockets.

Certificates must be created for the **SatGam server running on the MacBook Pro**. Phones reach the server through a concert network using a **tp-link AX73 Wi-Fi 6 Router**.

In this setup:

- **MacBook Pro** runs `server.py`
- **AX73 router** provides the private LAN and Wi-Fi
- **phones** connect to the MacBook through the AX73 network
- `mkcert` creates the SatGam server certificate and its local certificate authority (CA) 

This guide assumes SatGam lives at:

    `/Users/gs/Developer/SG/SatGam`

The MacBook Pro has a fixed AX73-side IP address:

    `192.168.1.10`
    
The secure ports are:

    `HTTPS: 8443`

    `WSS: 8444`

The server is run from terminal using the following commands:

```gs@MacBook-Pro-2 ~ % cd /Users/gs/Developer/SG/SatGam
python3 assets/python/server.py \
  --tls \
  --https-port 8443 \
  --wss-port 8444 \
  --cert-file assets/certs/SatGam.pem \
  --key-file assets/certs/SatGam-key.pem \
  -r .
```
The server listens for phones as each player launches the app by scanning a QR code on their phone

**Part 1 — Create and install the SatGam certificates**

Open a Terminal window and run the following commands.

1.	**Go to the SatGam folder**

	`cd /Users/gs/Developer/SG/SatGam’

2.	**Create and install a fresh local CA**

	`mkcert -install`

Expected output will be similar to:

	```Created a new local CA 💥
	Sudo password:
	The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
	The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! 🦊```

If Firefox is open, restart it after this step.

3.	**Create the SatGam server certificate and private key**

	```mkcert \
  	-cert-file assets/certs/SatGam.pem \
  	-key-file assets/certs/SatGam-key.pem \
  	192.168.1.10 MacBook-Pro-2.local localhost 127.0.0.1```

Expected output will be similar to:

	``` Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - “192.168.1.10"
 - "MacBook-Pro-2.local"
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"

The certificate is at "assets/certs/SatGam.pem" and the key at "assets/certs/SatGam-key.pem" ✅```

4.	**Copy the root CA certificate for performer-phone installation**

`cp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem" assets/certs/SatGam-rootCA.pem`

This creates a clearly named copy of the mkcert root CA certificate for distribution to performers.

5.	**Validate the certificate files**

`ls -l assets/certs`

Expected files:

```SatGam.pem
SatGam-key.pem
SatGam-rootCA.pem
```

Example:

```
total 24
-rw-------  1 gs  staff  1708 14 Apr 08:18 SatGam-key.pem
-rw-r--r--  1 gs  staff  1781 14 Apr 08:18 SatGam-rootCA.pem
-rw-r--r--  1 gs  staff  1614 14 Apr 08:18 SatGam.pem
```

**Part 2 — Launch the secure SatGam server**

Open a **new Terminal window** and leave the certificate window available.

6.	**Launch server.py using the SatGam certificate and key**

```
cd /Users/gs/Developer/SG/SatGam
python3 assets/python/server.py \
  --tls \
  --https-port 8443 \
  --wss-port 8444 \
  --cert-file assets/certs/SatGam.pem \
  --key-file assets/certs/SatGam-key.pem \
  -r .
```

Expected output will be similar to:

```
——— Preflight ———
✅ no auto-start in main.js
✅ robust wsPort parsing present (qsPort)
⚠️ leader.html did not show a direct import during preflight (static check).
If you see [ws] connections later, WS is wired at runtime.
⚠️ consort.html did not show a direct import during preflight (static check).
If you see [ws] connections later, WS is wired at runtime.
———— End preflight ————
[wss] Listening on wss://0.0.0.0:8444
[https] Serving /Users/gs/Developer/SG/SatGam on https://0.0.0.0:8443
```

**Note**
0.0.0.0 means the server is listening on all local interfaces, including:
* localhost
* the home-side interface
* the AX73-side interface
* 192.168.1.10

**Part 3 — Create Leader and Consort QR codes**

Open another Terminal window if needed.

7.	**Generate the QR codes**

```
cd /Users/gs/Developer/SG/SatGam
python3 assets/python/make-qr.py \
  --scheme https \
  --host 192.168.1.10 \
  --http-port 8443 \
  --ws-port 8444
```

Expected output will be similar to:

```
QR font file: /System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Arial.ttf
QR font name: ('Arial', 'Regular')
LABEL ROLE = 'Phonehenge - Leader'
LABEL ROLE = 'Phonehenge - Consort'
Base URL: https://192.168.1.10:8443
WebSocket port: 8444
Font size: 18
Leader  → assets/qr-images/qr-leader.png -> https://192.168.1.10:8443/leader.html?wsPort=8444
Consort → assets/qr-images/qr-consort.png -> https://192.168.1.10:8443/consort.html?wsPort=8444
Scan from phones while the server is running on the same Wi-Fi.
```

8.	**Validate the QR image files**

```ls -l assets/qr-images```

Expected files:

```
qr-leader.png
qr-consort.png
```

**Resulting secure URLs**

The QR codes should now point to:

- **Leader**

`https://192.168.1.10:8443/leader.html?wsPort=8444`

- **Consort**

`https://192.168.1.10:8443/consort.html?wsPort=8444`

```
